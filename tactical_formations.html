                    <p>
                        There are countless scenarios in which you would use every
                        single formation I am about to tell you about, but depending
                        on what situation you are in determines the right formation
                        to use to give you and your team the highest chance of
                        survival. In this section I will show you what each
                        formation looks like and when is best to use them.

                    <h2>Wedge Formation</h2>
                    <p>
                        A wedge is primarily used when there is known enemies in
                        the area and provides 360 degree security. This formation
                        can be spread out based on the type of terrain you are on.
                        ie: If you are in a field the distance between each soldier
                        is greater than if you are in a wooded area. In this
                        formation the team leader can also decide whether they want
                        to be strong right or strong left and this is determined by
                        which side of the wedge the machine gunner is located.
                        Youâ€™ll notice that the soldiers are offset from one another
                        and the reason behind this is so the enemy cannot fire in
                        one direction and hit more than one soldier without
                        adjusting fire.

                    <div id="staggeredcolumntext">
                        <p>
                            This formation is used when your team/squad etc. is
                            travelling along a road or some sort of wide trail and
                            again provides 360 degree security. The soldiers are again
                            offset from one another and the reason behind this is
                            so the enemy cannot fire in one direction and hit more
                            than one soldier without adjusting fire.

                    <p>
                        This formation is mainly used to protect against the
                        enemy flanking from a certain side and allows for maximum
                        firepower to be delivered in the direction of the enemy
                        flank.

                    <h2>Line Formation</h2>
                    <p>
                        This formation is only used when you are under fire from
                        the enemy. This formation allows maximum firepower to be
                        delivered to the front and gives the team the best chance
                        to gain fire superiority over the enemy and effectively
                        suppress them.

                    <p>
                        This formation is used when time is of the essence
                        because the team/squad can move the fastest in this
                        formation but this also has the least amount of security.
                        This is also used when the team encounters thick brush and
                        heavily wooded areas where soldiers cannot easily spread
                        out. The soldiers do not have to necessarily aim their
                        guns to the left or right but their heads must always
                        be on a swivel in this formation.

                    <p>
                        This formation (also known as the serpentine formation)
                        is used when a fire team has to move down a hallway or
                        trench and allows for maximum security while doing so.
                        This formation also provides protection in the rear of the
                        formation. The soldiers can either decide to do a
                        crossfire technique or look straight down the hallway
                        covering thier own sector in order to secure doors or
                        windows that may appear further down the hallway.
