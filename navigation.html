                        It is very important to be able to read a map effectively
                        so you can either locate yourself on the battlefield
                        or mark and find a location of interest on the map.
                        Having adept knowledge on how to use a map to your
                        advantage is a must and can also prevent you from
                        wandering aimlessly throughout the land if you are ever
                        seperated from your unit.

                    <h2>Contour Lines:</h2>
                    <p>
                        These are the several lines on a map that represent
                        the elevation of an area on a map.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Contour Interval:</h2>
                    <p>
                        The contour interval refers to the vertical elevation
                        between two or more contour lines and is used to determine
                        the slope of an area on the map.

                    <p>
                        Without getting very technical with crazy terms that makes
                        things hard to understand, think of an azimuth as an
                        imaginary, perfectly linear line that starts at your
                        compass and goes in the direction you are pointing. There
                        is a number on your compass that is associated with this
                        imaginary line and that is your azimuth.

                        <p>
                            It is important in land navigation to know how to convert
                            azimuths so you can effectively navigate your way through
                            any terrain. If you need to convert any azimuth you’ll need
                            to know something that is called the G-M angle and this is
                            found on every map in the legend and varies based on where
                            you are in the world. For converting from a grid azimuth to
                            magnetic azimuth, add the value of the G-M angle to the
                            grid azimuth. If you want to convert the other way,
                            magnetic azimuth to grid azimuth, you simply subtract the
                            G-M angle from the magnetic azimuth.

                    <p>
                        <span>Intersection</span> – This method is used when you want to know
                        the location of an unknown point on the map by using two
                        other known points.

                    <ol>
                        <li>First when using a map, you want to orient the map with
                            the compass and then mark your position on the map.
                            (If not known use resection to find your location)</li>
                        <li>Take the magnetic azimuth of the unknown position using
                            your compass</li>
                        <li>Your compass gives you what is called a magnetic
                            azimuth and the azimuth on the map is called a grid
                            azimuth. You’ll need to convert from the magnetic
                            azimuth to the grid azimuth.</li>
                        <li>You will now draw a line on the map along the
                            grid azimuth that goes through your position.</li>
                        <li>You will now move to the second known location on the
                            map and repeat the steps up to this step.</li>
                        <li>The location of the unknown point is where these two
                            lines intersect on the map. (Use more than two known
                            locations for more accurate result but you’ll need at
                            least two known points)</li>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Note: You will want to use the resection method when you do
                            not know your current location on a map and need to locate
                            your position.</li>
                        <li>Similar to the Intersection method, you’ll want to orient
                        the map using your compass and then identify at least two
                        locations that you can visually see and mark them on your
                        map.</li>
                        <li>Convert the magnetic azimuth to the grid azimuth,
                            then get a back azimuth using your grid azimuth.</li>
                        <li>Draw a line on the map with the back azimuth you
                            obtained from the known location back toward your
                            unknown location.</li>
                        <li>Repeat this process for the second known position.</li>
                        <li>Where these two lines intersect is your position on the map.</li>
