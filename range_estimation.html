                    <h1>Overview</h1>
                    <p>
                        This section will give you some general knowledge and
                        understanding on how to use mildots for any scope.
                        This also goes over how to quickly find a fairly accurate
                        estimation of range if you ever find yourself without
                        those trusty rangefinders.

                    <h2>What is a mildot?</h2>
                    <p>
                        First things first, a “mildot” is an abbreviation for
                        milliradian also known as an MRAD or mil for short.
                        A milliradian accounts for 1/1000 of a radian.
                    </p>

                    <h2>What is a radian?</h2>
                    <p>
                        A radian is a unit of angle that is located at the center
                        of a circle and its arc is equal in length to the radius of
                        the circle. Essentially, this is the distance that is
                        traveled around the circle.

                    <h2>Mathematical Basics</h2>
                    <p>
                        It has been argued about how many milliradians are in a
                        complete circle. The Russian army says there are 6,000
                        milliradians in a circle while the US Army says a circle
                        has 6,400 milliradians for some unknown reason.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Pi is half of a circle which is equal to 3.14159265359
                        radians so multiply that by 2 and you get 6.28318530718
                        radians, so in milliradians that would be approximately,
                        6,283 milliradians in a circle. We’re just going to round
                        for easier math.

                    <h2>Rapid Range Estimation Trick</h2>
                    <img class="maincontentimages" src="assets/images/mil_ranging.jpg" alt="Range Formula" >
                    <p>
                        What you need to do first is look down your scope,
                        zoom in as much as your scope will let you if at all
                        possible, then you need to estimate the height of your
                        target in meters, multiply that number by 1000. We will
                        call this number X. Now what you need to do is use any
                        one of the scope techniques I talked about earlier to find
                        the height of your target in mildots. Once you have that
                        number, divide your number X by the mildot height of your
                        target. This will give a rough estimation of the distance
                        to your target.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <strong>Example:</strong>
                    <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Target is 1.8 meters tall (average height of an adult male)</li>
                        <li>1.8 x 1000 = 1800</li>
                        <li>Target is 3 mildots high</li>
                        <li>1800/3 = 600 yards to target</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>
                        Note: On a traditional scope the reticle will look like a
                        series of mildots going perfectly vertically and
                        horizontally through the scope. The distance between these
                        dots is equal to exactly 1 mil. On the right are a few
                        more examples on how to find range with different units
                        of measurement.

                    <h2>Quick Tip For Using Mildots</h2>
                    <p>
                        So when you are looking through the scope, you can use the
                        mildots for quick adjustment to a target. Say you have to
                        adjust up 2 mildots for a target at a distance. Instead of
                        making a certain amount of clicks to your scope to
                        accommodate for the distance, you can simply put the second
                        mildot below the crosshairs on the target and you should be
                        able to hit the target. This isn’t as accurate as using
                        clicks on the scope but is still a fast and effective
                        technique to use in a pinch.
