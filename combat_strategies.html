                        It is inevitable that you and your team/squad are going to
                        make contact with the enemy at some point in time so it is
                        crucial that your team is prepared with the proper equipment
                        to execute the mission successfully as well as being armed
                        with the knowledge of what to do in certain situations.
                        This section is going to give you and your team a broad
                        overview of the different strategies and tactics needed
                        to win the battle.

                    <h2>Squad Attack</h2>
                    <p>
                        One of the first things that your squad will need to
                        know is how to conduct a squad attack. This is a simple
                        yet effective tactic to gain dominance over the enemy and
                        eliminate them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When your squad is taking fire from the enemy, the Alpha
                        team leader (or whichever team leader is leading the
                        formation at the time) needs to quickly get his team in the
                        line formation and rapidly start returning fire in the
                        direction of the enemy. Note: These shots do not need to be
                        accurate because their only purpose is to gain fire
                        superiority over the enemy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The next step in the process is for the squad leader to
                        decide which direction they want Bravo team (trailing team
                        in the formation) to flank. Once this decision is made
                        Bravo team is going to move out and keep as concealed as
                        possible on their way towards the flanking position. This is
                        all happening while Alpha team is keeping the enemy’s heads
                        down with steady, constant fire.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once Bravo team is in place, they will signal Alpha team
                        to shift their fire in a certain direction in order to
                        avoid casualties from friendly fire. From here Bravo team
                        will start advancing towards the enemy and clearing the area.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After Bravo team has successfully swept through the
                        area, they will signal Alpha team to pick up and clear the
                        area from their direction.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once all enemies have been eliminated the squad can
                        reassemble and start evaluating its next moves.
                    </p>
            </div>
                </div>

                    <h2>Breaking Contact</h2>
                    <p>
                        Breaking contact is a tactic used when your squad is
                        outnumbered or outgunned by a larger enemy element.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At your squad leader’s discretion, they will call for a
                        breaking contact movement. They will designate which team
                        is going to suppress the enemy while the other team bounds
                        backward to a new firing position and starts returning fire
                        on the enemy. Once the team that bounded is set in place,
                        the team that was originally suppressing fire will then
                        bound back to a new firing position.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This process will repeat as many times as needed until
                        all friendly units have disengaged from the enemy.

                    <h2>Ambush</h2>
                    <img class="maincontentimages" src="assets/images/ambush.jpg" alt="Ambush" >
                    <p>
                        An ambush is a surprise attack on a moving or halted
                        enemy force and is implemented to maximize the most amount
                        of damage and destruction on the target in the shortest
                        amount of time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before you implement an ambush, you’ll want to know where
                        the enemy is going to come from and the size of the enemy
                        force you will be ambushing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First, you will want to deploy an early warning team
                        further down from where the ambush will take place in both
                        directions of where the enemy may come from.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You will want to deploy your most casualty producing
                        weapons on each side of the ambush so they can trap the
                        enemy in the kill zone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then you’ll want to deploy each soldier out in a line
                        each with their own cone of fire.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After this is set up, you will designate a couple
                        soldiers to plant explosives (if necessary) in crucial
                        spots in order to cripple the enemy even further.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whatever it is that initiates the ambush will be up to
                        the squad leader’s discretion.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Reacting to Indirect Fire</h2>
                    <p>
                        There are a few things you can do to ensure your survival
                        if you ever find yourself under an artillery or indirect
                        fire attack.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One thing you can do is to be alert and listen for the
                        sounds of artillery. An incoming shell will make a very
                        high pitched sound and you will be able to hear the
                        artillery being fired in your direction before it even
                        lands and detonates near your position.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you do hear the sound of artillery, immediately yell
                        out “INCOMING!!” This lets your squad/team know to seek
                        cover or get as low to the ground as possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You will need to move your position as quickly as
                        possible to get out of the impact zone. Your squad/team
                        leader will usually call out a direction for you and your
                        fellow soldiers to run to get to safety as fast as possible.
                    </p>
